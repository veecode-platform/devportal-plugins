# The Plugins Folder

All plugins in this workspace were added to the parent app with static imports and using their defaults.

This means that you can access them by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to their respective paths.

Please understand the README.md files in each plugin folder are shown in npm registries, so keep those files with useful documentation.
